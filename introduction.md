# Setup Taxify API Documentation


You will need a taxify account to make use of the Taxify API. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for a free trial at: http://taxify.co

Our goal for Taxify Web Services is to provide a complete suite of flexible, easy to use methods that allow you to create a seamless integration with your solution.

We're looking forward to having you be a part of the Taxify process!
