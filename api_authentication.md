# API Authentication

JSON requests to Taxify web services require a "Security" node with a password, i.e:

Security:{Password:'[API Key]'},

To retrieve your API key, visit the "Custom API" page in your Taxify account. You can access this page by navigating to Setup, Connect Your Apps, then clicking the "Taxify API" icon from the Taxify menu.
